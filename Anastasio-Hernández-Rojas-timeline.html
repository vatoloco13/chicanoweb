        <h1>The Anastasio Hernández Rojas Case </h1>

                        Border Patrols inadequate use of force policies and extreme lack of accountability have led to a culture of violence and impunity that has devastated border communities for decades. The case of Anastasio Hernández Rojas, a longtime San Diego resident who was brutally tased, beaten and killed by U.S. border agents is the story of the struggle for justice in the borderlands.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Because of the egregious miscarriage of justice in this case — which includes not only a failure to bring charges against the agents involved, but also the attempted coverup of the incident by law enforcement — Anastasio’s family has brought their case before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR),
 which will now sit on judgement of the Unites States and address the structural impediments to justice in cases involving border agents and other law enforcement officers.
This is the first known extrajudicial killing case that will be decided by the IACHR involving U.S. law enforcement. The outcome of this case could set a precedent for other cases against border authorities and other police who have killed with impunity, especially in Black and Brown communities.

<h3> 2010</h3>

<div>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>On May 28, 2010 at the San Ysidro Port of Entry, border agents beat, Tased and suffocated Anastasio until he stopped breathing. He was revived and remained on life support for several days until he died on May 31, 2010.</li>
            <li>CBP immediately attempted to cover up the incident; they manipulated the facts, dispersed eye witnesses and erased their cell-phone videos, disappeared government video footage, withheld evidence from police investigators, and interfered with the investigation.</li>
            <li>Autopsy reports confirmed that Anastasio suffered extensive injuries while in custody, including bruising and abrasions on his face and body, five broken ribs, and hemorrhaging of internal organs and neck muscles. Mr. Hernández died after suffering a heart attack, cardiac arrest, and brain damage. His death was ruled a homicide.</li>

<h3>2011</h3>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Anastasio’s family filed suit for wrongful death and civil rights violations in 2011 — a suit that was stalled repeatedly by the U.S. government.

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                New eyewitness video surfaced contradicting CBP’s assertion of facts, showing  border agents beating and Tasing Anastasio repeatedly while he was handcuffed, face down on the ground. The video gained national attention when it was broadcast on PBS’s Need To Know.
            </li>
            <li>
                Anastasio’s mother and brother traveled with Alliance San Diego to Washington, D.C. to meet with lawmakers to raise awareness about the case and with the Department of Justice to request that they review the new video and investigate the incident for possible criminal charges.

            On July 29, 2013—more than three years after the incident and only as the result of the wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family—a federal judge in San Diego finally lifted a protective order that had kept secret the names of the Border Patrol agents involved in this incident.

        <ul>
            <li>
                In February 2017, the United States settled the civil lawsuit with the Hernández family. The family made the difficult decision to settle without a judgement from the civil court because they feared the Trump administration would target the family and make their suffering worse.
            </li>
            <li>
                On May 10, 2017, the IACHR announced that it would move forward with the case, giving the US government the opportunity to respond to allegations of extrajudicial killing, torture, and obstruction of justice. This is the first case alleging an unlawful killing by law enforcement opened by the IACHR against the United States.

                The Trump Administration responded, arguing that the IACHR did not have jurisdiction to hear the case. Anastasio’s family responded back that IACHR did indeed have the authority to decide this case.  Click here for the response brief from March 2018.

                In August 2019, Alliance San Diego hosted the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights during their visit to the southern border region as part of their investigation of Trump's inhumane border policies. Many human rights organizations and impacted community members shared their stories and experiences with the IACHR, including Maria Puga, widow of Anastasio.

                On May 28, 2020, Anastasio’s family marked the 10th anniversary of the incident that led to his death a few days later. The family awaited a decision from IACHR to decide the jurisdictional question and advance to the merits stage of the case.
            </li>
            <li>

<h3>2021</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In January 2021, Anastasio’s family, represented by Alliance San Diego and the UC Berkeley International Human Rights Law Clinic, filed a brief including new testimony from three former Department of Homeland Security officials who point to a cover-up in the landmark case before the IACHR.
            </li>
            <li>
                November 2021, the United States failed to file a response and answer to the allegations of impunity of border agents submitted by Anastasio's family to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR).

<h3>2022</h3>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                On August 15th 2022, Anastasio's family took the next step in the case and submitted a request for a hearing before the IACHR for its fall session, which begins in late October. The request comes at a time when the United States faces increasing scrutiny for the widespread coverup of killings and other misconduct by border agents.
            </li>
            <li>
                On October 4th 2022, the IACHR granted Anastasio's family's request to hold a hearing to determine whether United States law enforcement officials used the power of the state to kill Anastasio, cover it up, and deny the family access to justice. The hearing, which will be virtual and broadcast live, has been set for November 4, 2022, at 4:00 pm eastern.
